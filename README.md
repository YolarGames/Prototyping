# The code in this repo is of prototype quality
Meaning:
1. **There is a lot of dirty decisions and shortcuts** and things that will create a technical debt in real projects. The decisions to make those is intentional and conscipus to spare some time 
3. **There could be unfinished features** or features that lacks basic functionality. If you see that it means that I want to prototype a certain features and don't care about the rest either because they implemented or i know how to implement them
4. **The structure of this repo is extremely flexible**. The features could be removed and added any time
